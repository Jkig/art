# General ToDos:

# Following and serverless:
* I've took some minor shortcuts, but now have learned a lot, ready to do this better.
* I need to make a few serverless functions (cloud functions on GCP in this case)
* first convert the main paige to a cloud function to get the info to load
* then impliment the same with the following page, which is this plus a little more complex queries which need more permissions
* then re-up security

# Still thinking about ideas for evening posts out
* there are tradeoffs here, especially when I want it to be very accesable on phones.
* Could impliment mobile mode and desktop mode, where info is on the side or something on desktop, giving more space generally
